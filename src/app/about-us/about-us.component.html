          Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web
          designs. The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have
          scrambled parts of Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book. It usually begins
          with:</p>
        <p>
          “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore
          magna aliqua.”</p>
        <p>
          The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that
          doesn't distract from the layout. A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless filler
          text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content.</p>
        <p>
          The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used it on their dry-transfer
          sheets, and again during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled the text with their software. Today it's seen
          all around the web; on templates, websites, and stock designs. Use our generator to get your own, or read on
